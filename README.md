Note: This purpose of this document is to explain to a lay person the "All or nothing" Red Hat subscription policy.  This document does not provide a legal opinion or advice regarding Red Hat software subscription requirements.  Please check with your procurement and legal teams for advice.  If you have additional Red Hat software subscription questions, please contact your Red Hat Account Team.

When purchasing a Red Hat software subscription, the customer agrees to terms in their contract with Red Hat.  The contract typically includes an agreement to  terms found in Red Hat Product Appendices.  Appendix 1 (Software and Support Subscriptions) contains "the all or nothing" clause meaning if a customer is using Red Hat software they cannot selectively decide which instances need an active subscription.  For a particular Red Hat software product, active subscriptions are required for all instances.

As an example a customer is required to have active subscriptions for all RHEL instances regardless of the environment or where a particular RHEL instance is in regards to the RHEL product lifecycle.  If the customer has versions of RHEL that are no longer receiving software patches or that are eligble for ELS (version 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, etc.) and the customer wants access to patches for current versions of RHEL, the customer will need to have active subscriptions for all RHEL instances.

See the subsection "Under the Maximize subscription benefits - Are there subscription guidelines":   
"Red Hat products are provided on a per-instance or per-installation subscription basis, which gives customers access to all subscription benefits during the subscription term. This means that while customers have an active subscription for a Red Hat product, they must maintain subscriptions for each and every instance or installation of Red Hat software being used in their environment."

[Appendix 1 (Software and Support Subscriptions)](https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_1_Global_English_20231205.pdf)  
From Appendix 1 section 1.2 Use of Subscription Services:  
"While you have a Subscription entitling you to receive Subscription Services for a Red Hat Product, you are required to purchase the applicable Subscriptions in a quantity equal to the total number and capacity of Units for that Subscription from the commencement of your use or deployment of such Subscription or a part thereof."
